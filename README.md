***Automaton Adventures***

In this RPG from Jump Back Studios, players take the role of a brand new lab assistant at Madd Labbs. Working for Dr. M. Madd in the new automaton division of Madd Labbs, players are placed in charge of the field tests and maintenance required during the testing process for the various automatons developed at Madd Labbs. As their adventures continue, players will meet other Madd family members, tame and train pets, research technologies to help their automatons perform better, collect old comics, and maybe even conquer that giant dandelion that keeps showing up in the garden....probably not though.

Automaton Adventures is an incremental progression RPG with a sense of humor. In a world where things have gone Madd, players get to be a beacon of hope, sensibility, and wrench swinging button tappery goodness! Take the new automatons from Madd Labbs out for a spin and keep swinging that wrench, faithful (and now, contractually obligated) assistant!
