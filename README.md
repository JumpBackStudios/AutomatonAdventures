## Overview ##

__Automaton Adventures: Prototype Edition__ (AA:PE) is the offline single player prototype for __Automaton Adventures__.

The goal of AA:PE is to focus on implementing and refining the incremental progression mechanics and UI that will form the foundation of the full __Automation Adventures__ experience.

Many of the online/multiplayer components of __Automaton Adventures__ will not be included in this prototype, hence the decision to differentiate between the two versions. This means that features like user logins, cloud saves, leaderboards, events, achievements,  social features like chat and friends/teams, pvp and others will not appear in this prototype.

In other words, basically any features that will utilize online mechanics are largely outside the scope of this prototype.

## Current status ##

Win64 only.

Mouse/tap controls only. Support for keyboard/gamepad controls will be added later.

The basic game progression loop is playable.

All planned automatons are available in game and can be unlocked via area progression. There is no maximum level cap currently (this will change in the future).

No 'final' graphics have been implemented. All art in the game should be considered temporary and only for demonstrating functionality.

Currency (currently shown as wrenches, in normal and gold versions) can be gained by defeating enemies.

Normal wrenches can be spent on upgrading automatons (and your trusty multi-tool, of course). Gold wrenches currently can only be converted to standard wrenches, via the Madd Market exchange.

Time warping resets your stage progress, clears your normal currency and provides special currency (shown as a brain icon). That currency can be used to unlock and upgrade inventions, which provide passive bonuses.

Inventions can be purchased and upgraded. Many more of these will be added in future updates.

There are basically no error messages in the game at the moment. Things that logically should cause errors to appear (like trying to buy something without the required amount of currency, for example) will just fail silently with no indication of what failed or why.

## Planned prototype updates ##
