# **Patch Notes - v2023.3.24.1** #

This version should be compatible with saves from 23.1.24.1.

If you experience issues with the game not performing correctly after loading in to the main game, resetting your data through the options menu should fix any of those issues.

## New in this update ##

### Bosses have arrived! ###

- Each area now has a boss that must be defeated to continue to the next area. When the player has defeated enough enemies in an area (as shown by the Progress counter) the player can then challenge the boss.

- Bosses can drop normal and gold wrenches when defeated, regular minions can only drop normal wrenches.
  
- The first time you kill the boss of an area, it will always drop a gold wrench. Area bosses that were cleared in previous runs will only have a chance to drop a gold wrench.

### Auto/Farm Button Added ###

There is a new AUTO/FARM toggle button located to the right of the Area and Progress counters. Pressing the button switches between AUTO and FARM mode.

- When set to AUTO, the game will automatically attempt to challenge a boss as soon as the progress counter is completed. If set to FARM, the game will not automatically challenge the boss and will instead continue attacking minions in the current area.

- Players have a limited amount of time to defeat a boss before it escapes. If the boss escapes, the AUTO/FARM toggle will be set to FARM. The progress counter will then display "Farming..." and the player will continuously challenge minions from that stage.

- Once the progress requirement has been met for an area, players can choose to challenge the boss instantly at any time by toggling the FARM button to AUTO

- If players toggle to FARM mode during a boss fight, the boss fight ends immediately and new minions from that area will continue to appear until the player toggles back to AUTO mode.

### Stat Panel Now Available ###

In the upper right corner of the main game screen, you can click on the book icon to access your game statistics. At the moment there are only a few basic stats that are showing, with many more to come in the future.

The left side of the stat panel has a number of category buttons that will show different stats from that category in the right hand panel.

As with all our current UI, the stat panel is a very rough first draft that will change over time. Your suggestions are welcome!

### Shop Changes ###

Gold wrenches can now be purchased with normal wrenches via the exchange tab in the Madd Market.

### Other UI Updates ###

Reorganized the UI for the main game screen. Almost all UI elements have been moved/optimized in some way.

- Progression toggle added (see notes on "AUTO/FARM Button Added" for full details)
- Gameplay functions (such as weapon and invention upgrades) can be found on the action bar at the bottom of the screen.
- Locks cover the buttons for unavailable game functions on the action bar. 
- Miscellaneous functions like game options, the shop, and player stats can be found in the top right corner menu.
- The player info panel in the top left has been reorganized  
- A temporary avatar icon and name have been added. Customization options will be added in a future update.
- Currency ticker moved to be under the player info panel.
  
### New Inventions ###

- Added two new boss related inventions.


# **Patch notes - v23.1.24.1** #

This version is incompatible with previous save games. 

If you have a previous save, you will need to reset your data from the options menu. Alternatvely, delete the Jump Back Studios folder from *\Users\\[MachineName]\AppData\LocalLow*

If the game does not function properly after loading from the title screen, try resetting your data through the options menu. This resolves any issues that may occur if you have an incompatible save game.

While we try to avoid invalidating save games as much as possible, sometimes we need to make data changes (like the ones in this patch) that can cause saves to become invalid.

## New in this update ##

- 2 new Inventions to discover and upgrade
- Invention panel now has a state for when no more inventions can be discovered.
  
## Bug Fixes ##

- Fixed issue with Arsenal panel getting displaying values incorrectly when upgrading. 
- Current DPS Counter now calculates properly.
- Numerous UI performance updates.
