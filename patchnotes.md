# **Patch notes - v23.1.24.1** #

This version is incompatible with previous save games. 

If you have a previous save, you will need to reset your data from the options menu. Alternatvely, delete the Jump Back Studios folder from *\Users\\[MachineName]\AppData\LocalLow*

If the game does not function properly after loading from the title screen, try resetting your data through the options menu. This resolves any issues that may occur if you have an incompatible save game.

While we try to avoid invalidating save games as much as possible, sometimes we need to make data changes (like the ones in this patch) that can cause saves to become invalid.
